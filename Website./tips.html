       <h1> Baking Tips to Help Beginners </h1>
       <h3> Baking for the first time can be a daunting task for anyone. Don’t worry if your first recipes don’t turn out great. We all have to start somewhere. Some of my first treats were hardly edible... These tips were collected from experienced bakers and will help you make successes, and less messes!  </h3>
       <h2> 1. Lights, Camera, Cake! Your First Recipe. </h2>
       <h4>
Okay now I get if you think it is crazy to start with something as challenging as a cake. But, don’t fret. Baking a cake will give you an introduction to the techniques you will need for more complicated recipes later on. You can also start by making your cake in a brownie pan, so you don’t have to worry about multiple layers and pans for a traditional tiered cake. Also, a cake has a simple ingredient list with items that can all be found in your pantry. Head over to the recipes page to see my best buttercreme frosting and cake recipes! </h4>
       <h2> 2. Bring in the Stunt Double! </h2>
       <h4>
Imagine the horror of getting to the final ingredient of your recipe and realising you don’t have enough, and with stores closed or you home alone, there is nothing you can do. Well, don’t worry. There is. Subsititing different ingredients in recipes is a very common thing. Whether for dietary reasons or lack of the ingredient, there are many different stand ins that can be used. Below is a list of the most common subsitutions that won’t change the overall outcome of the recipe. As much as you can, stick to the recipe. There are certain reasons for using specific uncommon ingredients that, if not there, would greatly change your final product. </h4>
       <h2> 3. Double Trouble</h2>
       <h4> Now say you’ve perfected a delicious sugar cookie recipe and want to bring them to your friends? Now your recipe only makes a dozen cookies, but that won’t be enough. Instead of finding a different recipe that makes more cookies, just double the original recipe. Now you may be temped to click off because this is “common sense”. But stay with me. If you “double a recipe” what exactly gets doubled? Well, all the ingredients should be doubled (ei. 1 cup flour = 2 cups flour). Okay that’s simple. But what else needs to be doubled? If you’re making brownies and doubled it so it would fit into a bigger pan, you’re going to need to bake it for longer. Note that instead of inceasing and doubling the temperature, you have to increase the time and keep the original temperature. Unforunately, you can’t also just double the bake time unless you want charcoal brownies. A good rule of thump is to take the original time and add an additional 30%. So if your brownies take 30 minutes normally, doubled they should take at least 40 minutes (30 + (30% of 30 = 10) = 40). After that time just eye ball it and make a call if you need more time, it will depend on the recipe.
