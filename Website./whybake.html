       <h1> Why Learn to Bake? </h1>
       <h4>
Okay so maybe you have looked through the website and are totally lost because you think that baking is pointless. Or perhaps a friend or relative sent you this website in the hopes that you would pass along Grandma’s recipes. However you ended up at this website, my goal is to have you leave with at least some basic baking knowledge. Now you may be shaking your head and wondering why I’m so focused on teaching baking. Well, my friend, let me open your eyes to the wonderful world of baked treats full of love and gratitude.
 </h4>
       <h3> Is there even a problem? </h3>
       <h4>
Yes! For not just baking, but cooking as a whole! Nearly 60% of 18-25 year olds leaving home only know five recipes that they can cook. After age 25, people who haven’t learned how to cook/bake are extremely unlikely to pick up the skills and try to learn.
  </h4>
       <h4> “Nestle Toll House, a company that makes many products used for baking, including cookie mixes and chocolate chips, recently found that their once-loyal bakers were becoming older and not baking as often, and younger consumers weren’t replacing them at the same rate. The company considered the fact that few millennials were growing up learning to bake alongside their parents and grandparents, and were turning instead to digital platforms to learn, including online videos. “ -Maria Lamagna, a writer for the Guardian
</h4>
       <h3> Even if there is a problem, what’s in it for me to learn how to bake? </h3>
       <h4>
First off, all the delicious treats that you get first dibs for “taste testing”! Well if that’s not your fancy, perhaps living a more stress free life is? Baking is a natural form of stress reduction and therapy. Baking is meditative as you have to focus and use your whole attention to create something. The feel of the ingredients is stimulating to the senses. Touching flour, for example, can release endorphins into your mind, making you happier.
Baking also is about nourishing ourselves and when you create something it makes you proud of what you made. Learning to bake will heighten your creativity as it requires a creative mind. Plus,there have been many studies linking creative expression and overall wellbeing. Baking is also used to make other people happy. By surprising someone with a treat you make, you in turn feel happy too.
 </h4>

       <h4>Now with all those reasons, there isn’t any reason to not start the journey into creating. Make sure to check out the Tips page for some tips before you make your first treat, and the Recipes page for a great place to start!  </h4>
